StandardAlertv. 1.23/5/2001Charles Yeomansyeomans@desuetude.comIntroductionStandardAlert is a class which displays a standard alert box on screen.  It is a wrapper for the StandardAlert toolbox call; for information on the toolbox call itself, see the Mac OS 8 Dialog Manager documentation, available from http://www.apple.com/developer/ .  This class requires the Appearance Manager to be present, and checks for its presence. It has also been Carbonized.The code is contained in one class, along with one module.  A StandardAlertConstants module contains various constants; a list is given later.You're free to use the code as you wish, without restriction.  Suggestions for improvement in the code or documentation are welcomed.  If you know how to make this class work for Windows builds, please share.MethodsShowDisplays an alert box, with the options you have specified.PropertiesAlertType as IntegerThis property takes the values 0, 1, 2 or 3, corresponding to a Stop alert, a Note alert, a Caution alert, and a Plain alert respectively.  You can also use the constants kAlertStopAlert, kAlertNoteAlert, kAlertCautionAlert, and kAlertPlainAlert, conveniently provided in the StandardAlertConstants module, to set this value.  Use of other values will probably result in a -50 error.  The default is a Stop alert.CancelButton as IntegerSpecifies which button is the Cancel button; i.e. is clicked when the user cancels using the command-period key combination.  This property can, and should,  be set using one of the constants kAlertStdAlertCancelButton,  kAlertStdAlertHelpButton,  kAlertStdAlertOKButton,  kAlertStdAlertOtherButton.  Note that this button must be different from the default button (see below), otherwise the result will be a -50 error.  The default is the Cancel buttonCancelText as StringContains custom text for the Cancel Button; displayed only if useDefaultCancelText is false.DefaultButton as IntegerSpecifies which button is the Default button; i.e. is clicked when the user presses the Return or Enter keys.  This property can, and should,  be set using one of the constants kAlertStdAlertCancelButton,  kAlertStdAlertHelpButton,  kAlertStdAlertOKButton,  kAlertStdAlertOtherButton.  Note that this button must be different from the cancel button (see above), otherwise the result will be a -50 error.  The default is the OK button.Error as IntegerContains the last error generated as a result of calling the Show method.  Common error codes are:MacOS errors0 No error–50 Error in parameter list–108 Not enough memory–192 Unable to read resource–855 Help Manager not set upClass error600 Appearance Manager is not installedExplanation as StringThe secondary text you wish to displayed; it is displayed in the small system font.Message as StringThe primary text you wish to display.OKText as StringContains custom text for the OK Button; displayed only if useDefaultOKText is false.OtherText as StringContains custom text for the Other Button; displayed only if useDefaultOtherText is false.Result as IntegerAn integer representing the button pressed.  See Constants for the interpretation.ShowCancelButton as BooleanIf true, then a Cancel button is displayed in the alert box.ShowHelpButton as BooleanIf true, a Help button is displayed in the alert box.ShowOtherButton as BooleanIf true, a button is displayed in the third position.useDefaultCancelText as BooleanIf true, then the default button displays the default Cancel text; the value of this text depends on the localization of the system softwareuseDefaultOKText as BooleanIf true, then the default button displays the default OK text; the value of this text depends on the localization of the system softwareuseDefaultOtherText as BooleanIf true, then the default button displays the default text for this button; the value of this text depends on the localization of the system softwareConstantsAlert TypeskAlertStopAlert = 0; Stop alert box.kAlertNoteAlert = 1; Note alert box.kAlertCautionAlert = 2;  Caution alert box.kAlertPlainAlert = 3;  Alert box with no icon.Buttons	kAlertStdAlertOKButton = 1; The OK button. The default text for this button is “OK”.	kAlertStdAlertCancelButton = 2; The Cancel button (optional). The default text for thisbutton is “Cancel”.	kAlertStdAlertOtherButton = 3; A third button (optional). The default text for this button is“Don’t Save”.	kAlertStdAlertHelpButton = 4; The Help button (optional).RemarksThe rightmost button (= OK Button) is always displayed.I have not implemented every detail of the StandardAlert toolbox call; in particular, I have not done the work to make these alerts movable.  It looks like it would be simpler to go ahead and make an alert window using RB's Window class in this case.Note that an instance of this class lives on even after the alert window is closed, so that you can check to see which button the user pushed, and to check for OS errors.Changes1. 2.  Fixed a coding error which prevented setting custom text in the "Other" button -- thanks to Will Cosgrove for finding and fixing it; changed the demo to default to the buttons recommended by Apple HIG for Stop, Caution and Note alerts; fixed a few bits in the documentation.1.1.  Carbonized class; cleaned up the code internally here and there; made a few changes in the documentation.
